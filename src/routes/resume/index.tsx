            "Carried out admin duties on the website (bunq.com) such as managing user access and permissions, configurations, plugins, page structures, component schemas, and more in CraftCMS. Similar was also done for the forum website in Flarum, though less frequently.",
            "Made several improvements to the Flarum-based forum (including a WebView used by the banking apps): completed a large Flarum upgrade and UI redesign, added the ability to Google Translate posts, and made other general improvements to the PHP back-end and Mithril.js front-end.",
            "Built a web app in React where you could upload a photo of a receipt to a proprietary Machine Learning model and it would parse it into individual line items. You could then edit/split the bill and send out payment requests via email, SMS, or in the banking app.",

The entire project was full-stack with TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Tailwind CSS. Any frameworks were built custom and from scratch for the project (see below).",

            "Created a Spring-like REST API framework for Node.js for OOP TypeScript projects, which acted as a thin wrapper that added basic routing, comprehensive error handling, request processing and response creation features. It allowed me to create incredibly robust REST APIs.",
            "Created an incredibly comprehensive linting and formatting configuration and tool belt to apply strict guidelines and best practices. It was packaged in a way that made it easy to use in all my projects to maintain consistent quality control.",
