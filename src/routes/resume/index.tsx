          <p>
            My passion for technology started with an affinity for playing video games on computers.
            From the age of 14 onwards, that passion became the driving force behind intricate,
            novel & robust software solutions in a wide range of industries, sectors, and domains.
            Currently located in Amsterdam, I spend most of my time delivering countless key
            contributions and innovations at both adidas and Stentorian.
